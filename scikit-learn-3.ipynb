    "Feature extraction has many interesting facets beyond what is discussed here, a few things for you to research or think about:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **sparsity vs. density:** most of the vectors we have created in this notebook are _sparse_ vectors. Sparsity means that most dimensions of a vector has a `0`. At the same time, the number of dimensions grows with the vocabulary, which can easily be a six-digit number. There are ways of compressing sparse or overly long vectors into other vectors that have fewer dimensions. Those vectors are called **dense representations**.\n",
    "- **Length of history for sequences:** an n-gram vectorizer does not completely discard the order of sequence items, but the so-called \"history\" is limited to the n-gram size. In the context of neural networks, there are methods that guarantee **infinite history** and that can truly take sequences as features.\n",
    "- **integrated feature extraction:** in recent years, our community has made feature extraction part of the overall problem. This is very neat, since feature extraction can then be optimized like everything else. For instance, in a typical neural network for natural language processing, the first layers of the network actually implicitly perform feature extraction. This results in dense feature representations, or **embeddings**."
